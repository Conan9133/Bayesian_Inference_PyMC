# Bayesian_Inference_PyMC
This repository contains selected implementations of Bayesian inference models using PyMC, including MCMC sampling, posterior predictive checks, and hierarchical modeling examples. These were developed while studying probabilistic modeling and computational Bayesian methods.

1. Linear regression with Bayesian inference

2. Hierarchical model

3. Posterior predictive sampling

4. MCMC diagnostics
