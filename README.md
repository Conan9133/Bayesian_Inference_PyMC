# Bayesian Modelling with PyMC and Bambi

This repository contains selected implementations of Bayesian statistical models using PyMC and Bambi. The notebooks demonstrate hands-on experience with probabilistic modelling, hierarchical models, regression techniques, and uncertainty quantification.

## Topics Covered

### Regression Models (PyMC)
- Simple Linear Regression
- Logistic Regression
- Robust Regression
- Hierarchical Linear Regression
- Variable Variance Models

### Structured Modelling (Bambi)
- Polynomial regression and splines
- Categorical predictors and interactions
- Distributional models
- Variable selection

## Technical Focus

- MCMC sampling
- Posterior inference
- Convergence diagnostics (R-hat, ESS)
- Posterior predictive checks
- Model comparison and interpretation
- Hierarchical modelling and shrinkage effects

## Motivation

While my primary research focuses on hybrid quantum–classical optimization algorithms, Bayesian modelling provides a principled framework for uncertainty-aware inference and model evaluation.

These notebooks were implemented while studying:
Osvaldo Martin, *Bayesian Analysis with Python* (Chapters 4 and 6),
and include my own extensions, parameter experiments, and diagnostics.

## Tools Used

- Python
- PyMC
- Bambi
- ArviZ
- NumPy / SciPy / Matplotlib
